  <h1>Multiplayer WebVR Demo</h1>
  <h2>Before you start</h2>
  <p>This game works with Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard v1 and Google Cardboard v2.</p>
  <p>To get the best experience, please tell me what device you are using</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Google Cardboard v2</h3>
    <img src="v2.jpg" alt="If the top of your cardboard does have a button, it's a Version 2" class="float-left">
    <p>
        The Cardboard v2 and its clones have a touch button that is reachable from the top of the Cardboard.
        You can identify this by looking at the top of your Cardboard.<br>
        If there is at least one button visible on the top, you've got a Cardboard v2.
    </p>
    <p>Press and hold the button to move</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Google Cardboard v1</h3>
    <img src="v1.jpg" alt="If the top of your cardboard does not have buttons, it's a Version 1" class="float-left">
    <p>
        The Cardboard v1 and its clones have no touch button. You can identify this by looking at the top of your Cardboard.<br>
        If there is no button visible on either side, you've got a Cardboard v1.
    </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Oculus Rift</h3>
    <img class="float-left" src="oculus.jpg" alt="Oculus Rift has been tested with the DK2">
    <p>
      For Oculus Rift the only tested version is the DK 2, but it should work with the DK 1 as well.
      You will need a WebVR capable browser and the Oculus Runtime.
